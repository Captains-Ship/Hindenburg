# Hindenburg

### WIP
Hindenburg is currently not in a particularly usable state, so it's recommended not to use it right now.

Hindenburg is a performant and scalable Among Us servers, complete with plugins.

It uses [SkeldJS](https://github.com/SkeldJS/SkeldJS) to interface with the Among Us protocol, as well as keeping state.
