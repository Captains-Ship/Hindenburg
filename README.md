### WIP
Hindenburg is currently not in a particularly usable state, so it's recommended not to use it right now.

# Hindenburg

Hindenburg is a completely customisable, performant and scalable Among Us server, complete with plugins and a sophisticated and configurable anti-cheat.

It uses [SkeldJS](https://github.com/SkeldJS/SkeldJS) to interface with the Among Us protocol, as well as keeping state.
