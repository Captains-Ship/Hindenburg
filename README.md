# Hindenburg
Hindenburg is a completely customisable, performant and scalable Among Us
server, complete with plugins and a sophisticated and configurable anti-cheat.

It uses [SkeldJS](https://github.com/SkeldJS/SkeldJS) to interface with the
Among Us protocol, as well as keeping state.

🚧 Hindenburg is currently in a work-in-progress, follow [#7](https://github.com/SkeldJS/Hindenburg/issues/7)
to keep up-to-date on what to expect for the v1 release.

🔮 Hindenburg has its own section in the SkeldJS discord server, as a place to
get help installing or to discuss plugins and updates. https://discord.gg/8ewNJYmYAU

## Features

### 🚦 Load Balancer
Hindenburg has a lesser-featured central server with the sole purpose of redirecting
clients to a suitable node.

### 🎨 Highly Configurable
Hindenburg is completely customisable with a simple json file, giving you full
control and meaning that you'll likely never have to touch the source.

### 🧩 Plugins
Hindenburg has full knowledge of what is going on in every game, giving you full
control over the behaviour of games and even the load balancer and worker nodes
themselves.

### 👮‍♂️ Anti-Cheat
With the power of [HACS](https://github.com/edqx/Hindenburg/blob/master/docs/HACS.md),
Hindenburg's Anti-Cheat System, you can make sure that cheaters are stopped quickly
through a highly customisable and easy anti-cheat config.

### 🧬 Reactor Support
Hindenburg also natively supports the Reactor modded handshake, giving you full
control over which mods your players are allowed to use.
