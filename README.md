### WIP
Hindenburg is currently not in a particularly usable state, so it's recommended
not to use it right now.

### Discord

Hindenburg has a discord server for help installing, discussing plugins and updates.

# Hindenburg
Hindenburg is a completely customisable, performant and scalable Among Us
server, complete with plugins and a sophisticated and configurable anti-cheat.

It uses [SkeldJS](https://github.com/SkeldJS/SkeldJS) to interface with the
Among Us protocol, as well as keeping state.

## Features

### Plugins
Through the use of [SkeldJS](https://github.com/SkeldJS/SkeldJS), Hindenburg
has full knowledge of what is going on in a game, as well as giving you the
ability to both listen to events and modify the behaviour of the server.

### Anti-Cheat
Since Hindenburg is aware of what goes on in a game, it also features a
sophisticated anti-cheat that is highly customisable, and allows you to quickly
take down cheaters with a simple ban system.

### Reactor Support
Hindenburg also natively supports the Reactor modded handshake, allowing you to
setup the server to require or block certain mods from players.

It also allows you to force players to have the same mods and the host of the
room that they join.
